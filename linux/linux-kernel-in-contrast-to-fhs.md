# Linux Kernel in Contrast to FHS

ChatGPT summary

Great question—this gets at the difference between **the kernel (what runs the system)** and **the FHS (how files are organized for userspace)**.

## 🧠 Big Picture

* **Linux kernel** = the core program that runs in memory and manages hardware, processes, and system calls
* **FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)** = a **convention** for how files and directories are laid out on disk

They operate at different layers.

## 🧩 Where *is* the Linux kernel?

### 1. On disk (according to FHS)

The kernel *binary* is typically stored in:

* `/boot` → **this is the key FHS-defined location**

You’ll usually see files like:

* `vmlinuz-<version>` → compressed kernel image
* `initramfs-<version>.img` → temporary root filesystem used during boot
* `System.map` → symbol table for debugging

👉 FHS explicitly reserves `/boot` for **bootloader + kernel-related files**.

---

### 2. In memory (when running)

Once the system boots:

* The kernel is **loaded into RAM** by a bootloader (e.g., GRUB)
* It does **not live in the filesystem anymore**
* It runs in a privileged space called **kernel space**

At this point, FHS is irrelevant—the kernel is just executing code.

---

### 3. As exposed to userspace (via FHS directories)

Even though the kernel itself isn’t “in” the filesystem while running, it **exposes interfaces through FHS paths**:

* `/proc` → virtual filesystem exposing kernel state (processes, memory, etc.)
* `/sys` → kernel device and driver model (sysfs)
* `/dev` → device files managed by the kernel

These are **not real files on disk**—they’re created dynamically by the kernel.

## 🔄 How they relate

Think of it like this:

| Component  | Role                                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kernel     | Executes system calls, manages hardware                        |
| FHS        | Organizes files that programs (and humans) interact with       |
| Connection | Kernel **implements** the behavior behind many FHS directories |

---

## ⚙️ Interaction flow

1. Kernel boots from `/boot`
2. Kernel mounts a root filesystem (structured per FHS)
3. Userspace programs follow FHS layout (`/bin`, `/etc`, `/usr`, etc.)
4. Programs call into the kernel via **system calls**
5. Kernel exposes system info via `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`

---

## 🧭 Key takeaway

* The **kernel is not “part of” the FHS**
* The FHS **describes the filesystem the kernel mounts and exposes**
* The kernel:

  * **lives in `/boot` before boot**
  * **lives in memory after boot**
  * **interfaces with userspace through FHS-defined paths**

---

If you want, I can map specific system calls (like `open`, `read`, `mount`) to how they interact with FHS paths—that’s where this gets really interesting.
